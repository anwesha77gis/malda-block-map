# QGIS Project: Malda Block Map

This is a personal GIS project where I worked on mapping the administrative block boundaries of Malda district, West Bengal, using QGIS. The project involved georeferencing a scanned map, digitizing each block boundary, and creating both image and PDF map outputs through QGIS's print layout tool.

## Project Contents

This repository includes the following files:

| File/Folder         | Description                                       |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| malda_blocks.qgz    | QGIS project file containing all layers and settings |
| malda_map.pdf       | Final exported map in PDF format                  |
| malda_map.png       | Image preview of the final block-level map        |
| shapefiles/         | Digitized polygon data for each block             |
| docs/               | Supporting files such as screenshots or legends (optional) |

## Techniques and Workflow

The following GIS techniques and tools were used in this project:

- Georeferencing a scanned administrative map of Malda
- Digitizing block boundaries using polygon layers
- Assigning basic attributes such as block names or codes
- Designing a layout including a title, legend, scale bar, and north arrow

## Tools Used

- QGIS (Long Term Release version)
- Scanned map of Malda district
- Coordinate reference system: EPSG:4326 (WGS 84) or UTM Zone 45N

## Purpose of the Project

The objective of this project is to create a clean, thematic base map of the block-level divisions of Malda district. It can serve as a useful reference for:

- Educational and research purposes
- Government or planning-related applications
- Regional development studies
- Thematic GIS mapping
